<h4>Export</h4>

<p>The export has two components:<br>
Python exports the data to the MySQL-database (EICC, EITI and the company information can be viewed). The data can also be edited, but this will have no influence on the next run. 
</p>

<p>Python also exports the data into a new excel-file, which is named YYYYMMDD_HHmmSS.xlsx. At this moment, the excel file contains all the outputs of the scrapers, all the metrics, the EICC-output, the EITI-output and the wikirate-output, the RTB-information. </p>

<p>Based on the choices of the user, the number of outputs can be limited. So just before the export, there is a screen to allow the user to:
	<ul>
		<li>Duplicate the existing records (the original record should not be modified) => this will be called an export-“profile”</li>
		<li>Modify the new profile, by selecting or deselecting scraper-outputs or metrics </li>
		<li>Start the action to export the desired selection. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
