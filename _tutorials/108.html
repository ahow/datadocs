<p>To start the analysis, you need to go to <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/company/">http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/company/</a>, select the company you want to run the analysis on, select the action “Run the cultural analysis for the selected companies” and click on Go. Again you will not see anything happening, but in the background the analysis has started. You will know it is finished, when there are success messages at the top. </p>
