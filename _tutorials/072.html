<h4>After the export: health check</h4>

<p>When the export is finished, you should still do a health check of the run.</p>

<p>You go to the main admin page and select the last task that has run (it should be marked FINISHED and not FAILED). You can open the logfile by clicking on it. Any line starting with ERROR or FAILED indicate that there have been issues during the run. For example, some metrics generate errors because they use datapoints that donâ€™t exist (yet). Some URLs fail and these are also marked as FAILED, etc. </p>
