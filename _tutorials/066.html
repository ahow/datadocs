<h4>Manual Running of parts of the script</h4>

<p>For the metrics and the datapoints, the previous explanations also apply. </p>

<p>There is just one difference: you have two actions: one is the normal one (you calculate the datapoints / metrics generated by the normal load), the same principle as with the inputfile. But you can also run this part from the file generated by the previous action.</p>

<p>In other words: you generated a modified scraper file (let’s call it delta-file  or manual file) starting from the inputfile of the last load (see previous slide). You can either run the action from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/base/output_last_run_datapoints_xls/">Output Last Run Datapoints Data File</a>-page, starting from the original file generated by the last load or you can start an action starting from the delta-file. Same for the metrics.</p>

<p>The scraper-action expects an inputfile as input. The datapoints-actions expect a scraper-file as input and the metric-file expect a datapointfile as input. If that is not the case, the actions will fail. I didn’t put any validation on it (yet).</p>
