<p>When you start a job (and wait till the job has started), you can see a button in the bottom right which allows you to kill a job. </p>

<p>When you click on it, the job is killed and you’re redirected to <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/admin_file/">http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/admin_file/</a>. In this table, the status of the job is updated to “KILLED BY USER”. </p>
