<p>If you want to know if a file finished (status should be different from ‘STARTED’), you have to go to <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/admin_file/">Output files</a>. 
</p> 
<p>In this table, you can find the information relevant to each file: where to find 
	<ul>
		<li>the filename, </li>
		<li>the outputfile for the input,</li>
		<li>the outputfile for the scraper</li>
		<li>the outputfile for the DS/BBG-datapoint-files</li>
		<li>the outputfile for the metrics</li>
		<li>The outputfile for the manual run</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The last 5 items will be explained later when I write about the manual run. By clicking on any of the links, you can download/open the files.
</p>
<p>You can also find the status here, the time of execution, etc. 
</p>
<p>By clicking on the logfile, you can see what went wrong and what was correct or where the load failed</p>
