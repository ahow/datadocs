<p>Connecting directly to <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/output/">http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/output/</a> you get the following screen, where you can select the Sectors, the Industries, the Regions, the years, the metrics and the datapoints you want to export. </p>
<p>Sectors, industries, region, years filter per row. <br>
The metrics and datapoints filter per column. </p>
<p>Another special aspect about this, is that there are no “region and industry”-columns in the table, so I used the isin codes to filter. Eg Nestle has an isin-code. If that isin code is in both the regions and the industries that the user selected, that record is kept, else not. </p>  
<p>Once the user clicks on download, he gets an open/save-pop up window.</p>
<p>There is now a possibility to use a filter to search the company or metrics and select them or deselect them. </p>
<p>The “(de)select all”-link allows you to select all the items and pass them to the left or right side. </p>
