<h4>Redirect to selection screen</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/070.png" alt="">

<p>At the end of the run, you will be redirected to “_all_1”-profile_detail. </p>

<p>To make things slightly more user-friendly, actions have been defined (at the top left of the screen, you can see a dropdown-box actions). Basically you can do mass-updates with that ((un)check all the boxes at once, (un)check all the boxes at once for one scraper, (un)check all the boxes at once for all the metrics/scrapers, etc. Additional actions can be added, if needed. The actions with the scraper involve an intermediary screen, which allows you to select the scraper. </p>

<p>The last action is to export the data (after you have made your selection and after you have saved the changes).</p>
