<h4>Create a record based on historic data</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/042.png" alt="">

<ul>
	<li>In order to create historical data, you have 3 additional fields
		<ul>
			<li>You have to check the time-series-field</li>
			<li>You need to define the length of the timeseries (eg if you have data for the years 2017 till 2010, you have 8 values for the years, so you fill in 8 there)</li>
			<li>The timeseries field order has not been implemented yet (you have choices between ascending and descending order). Right now, whatever you select, the order will always be descending, with the first value equal to the first value of the timeseries.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
