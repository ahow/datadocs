<h4>Empty the database</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/004.png" alt="">
<p>Normally, you start with an “empty” database, which means there are no companies and most of the tables are empty. 
</p>
<p>
  These tables should NOT be emptied (or the program will not function properly anymore): 
Scraper scripts: table containing the scripts
Scraper variables : table contains the parameters for the different scrapers
Wikirate metric list: the metric lists for the wikirate-scraper
Match uploaded columns to scraper inputs: match between input-excelfile and python names
Invest IQ Input: can be emptied, but then the investIQ will not work properly
Ranking the brands rankinglists: used for RTB, list of rankinglists
Ranking the brands currency converter table: used for RTB: currency converter table
Define datapoints: datapoint definition
Define metrics: define metrics
List of scrapers: list of scrapers used for getting the URLs for the inputfile
Words to exclude from company matching: words that are replaced by an empty string 
Scripts to extract all company names: these are other scraper scripts
WIPO Codes and their descriptions: this table can be deleted, but then other parts will not work anymore
Config: constants
