<h4>Method 5: Using <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/output_last_run/">Metrics calculations results</a></h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/062.png" alt="">

<p>Table <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/output_last_run/">Metrics calculations results</a> shows the output results in a different format: </p>
<p>Another special aspect about this, is that there are no “region and industry”-columns in the table, so I used the isin codes to filter. Eg Nestle has an isin-code. If that isin code is in both the regions and the industries that the user selected, that record is kept, else not. </p>  
<p>For each company, for each metric/datapoint, for each year, for each sector, you can see the outputvalue. </p>
<p>These results can be exported using the action “export”</p>
