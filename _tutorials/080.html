<p>In company_source_scrapers from the admin view (<a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/company_source_scraper_scripts/">Company sources scraper scripts</a>; http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/company_source_scraper_scripts/), you can set the scrapers. As with the other scraper-scripts-table, you can see the python-colouring too. It could have been put together with the other scripts, but I prefered to separate them. </p>
