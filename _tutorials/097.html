<h4>DP not based on scrapers and not based on BBG/DS</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/097.png" alt="">

<p>There is a possibility to add datapoints to the output, that are not based on scrapers and not based on BBG/DS-datapoints:</p>

<p>In the _Multiple_Webscraper_.xlsx-file, add a sheet with the following specifications:
	<ul>
		<li>The sheetname should start with “DP_”</li>
		<li>The columns should be ISIN, year (this one is optional), name of the output-variable</li>
		<li>There can be several output-variables for 1 sheet</li>
		<li>The datatype can vary too : text (string) or number (integer/decimal</li>
		<li>Example with a year (left) and without (right)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The program, when it imports,</p>
<p>These datapoints are created after the scrapers have run and just after the datapoints from BBG/DS have been computed.</p>
<p>As they are inserted before the metrics are computed, you can use the name of the variables in the metric-definition table and they will be used as if they already existed before the load.</p>
