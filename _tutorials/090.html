<h4>Running a scraper based on other scrapers</h4>

<p>In some cases, you might want to create a variable which uses the outputparameters of the scrapers as input-parameters. Eg glassdoor, vorkers and many other employer-rating websites generate a review and ratings from employees. You might want to compute the weighted averages of these ratings. </p>

<p>The first thing to do is to create a new “scraper” in the table <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/admin_scripts/">Scraper scripts</a> (left picture).  The important part in this is that the script starts with “z_”, to make sure that the other scraper-scripts are executed before this script (else you get errors during the run).</p>

<p>The second part is to create a record or several records based on the new scraper in table <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/input_scrapers_output/">Scraper variables</a>. </p>
