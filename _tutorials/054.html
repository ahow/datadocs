<h4>Selection of the outputvariables</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/054.png" alt="">

<p>At the end of a normal run, you will be redirected to this URL, which allows you to select which scraper-outputvariables, which BBG/DS-outputvariables and which metrics-outputvariables you want to export.</p>

<p>You can also define the formatting for each column. By default, the formatting defined in the ‘define metrics’, ‘define datapoints’ and <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/input_scrapers_output/">Scraper variables</a>-tables are used. At this moment, it can be modified still during the run.</p>

<p>You can use actions to check or uncheck several items at the same time. </p>

<p>This is also where you can export and use the simple_download-export.</p>
