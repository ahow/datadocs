<h4>After using the export-action<br>Modify the selection-profile</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/071.png" alt="">

<p>After using the export-action, you should also rename the profile to make sure it has a meaningful name.</p>

<p>To do this, you go back to the admin-page. You select Input_all_profiles. You will notice that it is not possible to add a new profile in the normal way. This is normal, it has been disabled to avoid that you have profiles without any profile_details. To add a profile, you can select one and copy it, using actions. Or you modify one, the same way. </p>

<p>The description is editable, so you should give it a good description. By default it is just “copy of <task_id>_all”</p>
