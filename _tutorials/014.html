<p>Different tables are used as input for python (and can be modified through the admin views):</p>

<p><a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/admin_scripts/">Scraper scripts</a> table contains the different scraper-scripts.
<br>
When you click on it, you see the list of the different scrapers which have been defined (left upper picture). 
<br>
As can be seen in the right corner at the top, you can recover previous versions (version control exists for changes) or you can add new scrapers.
</p>

<p>When you click on a scraper-name, you get the information on that particular scraper (left bottom picture). It is also possible here to recover the previous versions of the script.
</p>

<p>If the parameter “debug_mode” in config is set to False, the scripts from the database (visible in the admin views) will be used.

If the parameter “debug_mode” in config is set to True, the scripts from the files stored on the server will be used.​
