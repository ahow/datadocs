<h4>Import companies</h4>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/007.png" alt="">

<p>There are many ways to insert companies in the database:
	<ul>
		<li>Manually, by selecting company (add) and filling in the data</li>
		<li>Using the _Multiscraper_.xlsx-file, see later</li>
		<li>
			But the most normal way to insert companies is to use an excel file. 
			<ul>
				<li>Click on <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/company/">Company list</a></li>
				<li>If the actions are not visible (because there are no records in the table), create a dummy record.</li>
				<li>Select the action “Import the file with the companies.” (The same can be achieved using the button in the upper right corner)</li>
				<li>You will be redirected to another url</li>
				<li>Browse for the file</li>
				<li>Upload the file</li>
				<li>Example of the file in the presentation</li>
				<li>Once the file has been uploaded, it will be saved in the table <a href="http://scrapecalctool.scibizinformatics.com/admin/base/exported_input_file/">Output of the inputfile</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>There is no validation on the file, so it might crash if the formatting is not correct.</li>
	</ul>
